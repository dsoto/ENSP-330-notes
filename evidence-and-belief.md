# Team-Based Epistemology

## Questions

- Why don't we act on scientific data?
- Why does our acceptance of data depend on our social and political groups?
- What damage does a resistance to scientific data create?

## Team-Based Epistemology

Evidence is emerging that our processing of new scientific knowledge (epistemology) is strongly influenced by our existing beliefs and our social groups (team).

## Deflategate

In the 2014 NFL playoffs evidence emerged that Tom Brady and the Patriots deflated footballs to give themselves an advantage.

The percentage of belief in the innocence of Brady and the Patriots was different for New England residents compared to the nation.

## Motivated Numeracy Question

Researchers asked the questions:

- Do folks with higher degrees of scientific ability accept science more readily?
- Does our minds desire to protect our existing beliefs reduce our acceptance of new data?

## Motivated Numeracy Result

People with higher science and math ability were more likely to get math problems wrong when they conflicted with their beliefs.

This suggests that science education is not the key to climate change acceptance but rather understanding human psychology.

## Polling Data

Polling shows strong differences of opinion on climate science and the honesty of scientists according to political party.

## Curiosity Question

Researchers asked

- Can scientific curiosity mitigate the biased reasoning that we observe?

- [Vox Research Summary](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/2/1/14392290/partisan-bias-dan-kahan-curiosity)

## Curiosity Results

People who rated higher on a scale of scientific curiosity were more likely to search out information conflicting with their current views.

## What can't you see because of your team?

Do your social and political groups keep you from accurately seeing the evidence on

- Climate change
- Pesticides
- Genetically modified foods
- Tax Policy
- Sexual Assault
- Police Violence
- Russia and the 2016 Election
- Benghazi and Uranium One

## Guarding against bias

How will you guard against misinformation when it is designed for your mind?

Remember that internet companies have a very good idea of what you believe through what you choose to read.

## Being Wrong

Being Wrong catalogs the various types of cognitive mistakes and biases we can make.  It also asks us to see seeking out our mistakes as a virtue.

## Curiosity and Questions

Questions are a tool to gain a deeper understanding of issues.  The more questions you ask, the better your questions will become.

Don't think of questions as a demonstration of your ignorance.

Think of questions as a sign of your curiosity and intellectual power.
