# Energy Models

To support decisions about our energy systems, we must make quantitative estimates in systems that are too complex to gather complete information.

Constructing a model is the initial mental exercise we perform before a calculation.
In a model we determine the relationships and assumptions.

- If we are estimating energy what is it proportional to?
- What existing data can we base our estimate on?
- What simplifying assumptions are we making?


# Simple Warmup Models

If you need 2 cups of sugar for 25 cookies, how much sugar for 100 cookies?

If you are traveling at an average speed of 60 miles an hour for 3 hours, how far will you travel?


# Energy quantities

There are several types of energy quantities that come up frequently.

- Efficiency
- Efficacy
- Energy Density
- Carbon Intensity
