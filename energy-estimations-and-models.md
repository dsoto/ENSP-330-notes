# Energy Models

To support decisions about our energy systems, we must make quantitative estimates in systems that are too complex to gather complete information.

Constructing a model is the initial mental exercise we perform before a calculation.
In a model we determine the relationships and assumptions.

- If we are estimating energy what is it proportional to?
- What existing data can we base our estimate on?
- What simplifying assumptions are we making?


# Simple Warmup Models

If you need 2 cups of sugar for 25 cookies, how much sugar for 100 cookies?

If you are traveling at an average speed of 60 miles an hour for 3 hours, how far will you travel?


# Energy quantities

There are several types of energy quantities that come up frequently.
How do you decide which of these quantities is relevant to your estimation and decision?

Here is a list of types of quantities and their uses

- Unit Conversions
    - convert a quantity from one unit to another, keeping the dimension the same
- Efficiency
    - determine how much of one type of energy can be converted to another
- Energy Density
    - calculates the volume or mass required to generate an amount of energy
- Carbon Intensity
    - calculates the carbon released from a given amount of energy


# Standard Multiplier Prefixes

Often for energy quantities, we use the metric prefixes to express scientific notation.

# Power and Energy

Power is the rate of conversion of energy.

This means that energy is the product of a power and a time.

$$ E = P \cdot t $$

Usually, we make the estimation that the power is constant over the time period.


# Energy Density (Volumetric)

This is the quantity of energy that fits in a given volume.

# Energy Density (Gravimetric)

This is the quantity of energy that fits in a given mass.

# Gravimetric Energy Density for selected fuels

$$ \textrm{Fuel Density} = \frac {\textrm{Chemical energy contained in material}} {\textrm{Mass of material}} $$

## Fuel Density

| Material| Energy Density (MJ/kg) |
|--------|-----|
| Gasoline  | 45     |
| Crude oil | 42--44  |
| Natural gas | 33--37 |
| Coal | 12--31 |
| Wood | 14--16 |
| Lithium Battery | 0.5 |
