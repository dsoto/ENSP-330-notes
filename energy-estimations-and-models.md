# Energy Models

To support decisions about our energy systems, we must make quantitative estimates in systems that are too complex to gather complete information.

Constructing a model is the initial mental exercise we perform before a calculation.
In a model we determine the relationships and assumptions.

- If we are estimating energy what is it proportional to?
- What existing data can we base our estimate on?
- What simplifying assumptions are we making?


# Simple Warmup Models

If you need 2 cups of sugar for 25 cookies, how much sugar for 100 cookies?

If you are traveling at an average speed of 60 miles an hour for 3 hours, how far will you travel?

More important estimations of energy quantities are more complex, but use the same basic ideas as the two models above.

# Energy quantities

There are several types of energy quantities that come up frequently.
How do you decide which of these quantities is relevant to your estimation and decision?

Here is a list of types of quantities and their uses

- Unit Conversions
    - convert a quantity from one unit to another, keeping the dimension the same
- Density
    - converts volumes to masses
- Efficiency
    - determine how much of one type of energy can be converted to another
- Energy Density
    - calculates the volume or mass required to generate an amount of energy
- Carbon Intensity
    - calculates the carbon released from a given amount of energy

We will cover these in more depth in the Tools section of this chapter.
