# Energy Services

I claim that you have absolutely no interest in your energy source.
What you ultimately care about is what the energy is used for.  We will
discuss the benefits we get from our energy sources.

- Primary Energy
- Secondary Energy
- Heating
- Cooling
- Transportation
- Lighting
- Communication

# Questions
- What do we use energy for?
- Are there better ways to get what we want having a lower environmental
  impact?

# Learning Objectives
- Apply fundamental energy principles to explain how energy services are
  delivered

# Energy Efficiency

## Efficiency
- Whenever we convert energy, we are not able to convert all of it
- A measure of how well a resource is converted
- Defined as useful energy out divided by total energy in

<!--
MathJax has a bug and this won't render
$$\eta = \frac{E_{out}}{E_{in}}$$
-->


$$\eta = \frac{E_o}{E_i}$$


<!-- need reinforcement exercises here -->

## Example Efficiencies
- Electrical generators (70--99%)
- Electric motors (50--90%)
- Gas furnace (70--95%)
- Wind turbine (35--50%)
- Fossil fuel power plant (30--40%)
- Nuclear power plant (30--35%)
- Automobile engine (20--30%)
- Solar cell (5--28%)
- Fuel cell (40--60%)

## Multiplication of efficiencies
- When we want to know the efficiency of a process with many steps, we
  multiply the efficiencies at each step to get the total.

$$\eta_{total} = \eta_1 \cdot \eta_2 \cdot \eta_3 \cdots$$


# Energy Efficacy

Efficiencies are usually expressing energy to energy conversions and are dimensionless.
Sometimes, we want to express a quantity like the miles traveled per gallon of fuel or the amount of light provided per unit of electrical power.
These are called efficacies.

Usually they are a fraction with the quantity of service provided on the top and the amount of energy, power, or fuel input on the bottom.
