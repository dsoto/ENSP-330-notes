# Homework Peer Feedback

- After homework is collected, the solution will be posted
- The location of the solution isn't determined as of Aug 2nd.
- We spend time in class comparing each others work against the solution
- Students will give you feedback based on a rubric
- You will enter this feedback into a google survey and we will collect it.
- This will contain information on your answers, the perceived difficulty, and the time you spent.
- You will assess yourself on whether or not you need to redo the homework.

<!-- we will write a script to check who has submitted and if different from original -->
<!-- we will write a way to join this data to the grade sheet -->
