# Hydropower

## Energy basics
- We use the simplest model for the water as a mass at a height or
  elevation
- A mass $m$ lifted to a high $h$ has a stored gravitational potential
  energy of
$$ PE = mgh $$
- PE is in joules if mass is in kilograms, g = 9.8 m/s^2^ and the height
  is in meters

## Power
- How do we convert this to a power?
$$ energy = mgh $$
$$ \frac{energy}{time} = \frac{mgh}{time}$$
$$ power = \frac{m}{time} gh$$
$$ power = flow \cdot gh$$
- To get flow in mass per time we convert from volume per time

## Ancient Power Technology
- Waterwheels have been used for centuries
- Modern hydropower technology has added large scale dams

## Types
- Run of river
- Dams

## Hydropower is significant world wide

## Activity Objective
- You will gain practice with energy conversions and estimations

## Gasoline and car height

We want to compare the chemical energy in a gallon of gasoline to the
potential energy of lifting a car?

<!-- A gallon of gasoline contains approximately 120 MJ of chemical energy. -->

## Units
- What are the units of the energy = mgh formula if we use kilograms, g=10
m/sec, and h in meters?


## Gravitational energy
If that energy were totally converted into the gravitational potential
energy of the car, how high could you lift the car?  A Honda Civic has a
weight of about 1100 kg.


## Solution
$$ PE = mgh = 120 MJ = 1100kg \cdot 9.8 m/sec^2 \cdot h $$
$$ h = 120 MJ / 1100 kg / 9.8 = 11.0 km $$

# Energy Basics

## Wind Energy
- Converts kinetic energy to electrical energy
- Wind energy is the conversion of solar radiation to kinetic energy

## Kinetic Energy

A mass $m$ traveling at a speed $v$ has a kinetic energy

$$ \frac{1}{2} m v^2 $$

Note the units
$$ \frac {kg \cdot meter^2}{sec^2} = 1\ Joule $$

## Fan Law
![](../figures/VM-fan-law-1.jpg)

## Fan Law
$$ Power = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3 $$

- $\rho$ density of air (kg per cubic meter)
- $A$ swept area of wind turbine (square meters)
- $v$ velocity of the air (meters per second)
- Power is in watts

## Air density
- How much does the air weigh?
- About 1.2 kg per cubic meter
- Varies with altitude
- Varies with temperature

## Wind speed variation with height
- Boundary layer friction
- This is turbulence caused by the ground, trees, or buildings


## Air density

Hotter air is less dense

| Temperature (degrees Celsius) | Density (kg per cubic meter) |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0                             | 1.29                         |
| 15                            | 1.23                         |
| 30                            | 1.17                         |

## Efficiency limit
- Can you extract all the kinetic energy from the wind?

## Efficiency limit
![](../figures/VM-betz-law-1.jpg)

## Where do we want to put turbines?
$$ P = \frac{1}{2}\rho A v^3 $$

- Based on this formula, what are good locations?
- Away from the turbulent air on the ground
- Around steady winds
- In areas with good air density

## Similarities and differences

- We are moving from sources of energy to uses of energy

## Primary Energy
- Coal
- Oil
- Natural gas
- Sunlight
- Hydropower
- Wind power
- Which of these are used to create secondary energy?

## Secondary Energy
- Electricity is an energy carrier
- Gasoline

## Electricity is different than other energy carriers
- Invisible
- Indistinguishable
    - Once you put power on a grid, you cannot trace its path
- Immediate
    - Electricity is very difficult to store
    - Moving electricity is inefficient

## Grid
There is a complex system that distributes our electricity from the
point of production to the point of consumption
![Masters: REEPS2](../figures/grid_masters.pdf)

## Frequency control
This supply and demand must be balanced perfectly at all times or the
frequency will change.
![Masters: REEPS2](../figures/supply_demand_bathtub.pdf)

## Environmental Impact of Electricity
- In US, one-third of carbon emissions are from electricity
- A large fraction of fresh water withdrawals are for power cooling
- Pollutants from burning create toxic by-products


## Carbon intensity of electricity
The amount of carbon emitted per unit of electrical energy changes
depending on the state.
![EPA Egrid Data](../figures/egrid.pdf)

## World Generation
![](../figures/Annual_electricity_net_generation_in_the_world.pdf)

<!--
- dominated by fossil
- renewables dominated by hydropower
-->

## Thermal Electric Efficiency
The second law of thermodynamics tells us that much of the chemical
energy of fuel is lost as heat.
![](../figures/electricity_grid_efficiency.pdf)

## Quality of energy
- Electric energy is very high quality
- Electric conversion is inefficient
- It is best used for high quality tasks
- Are we better off burning natural gas to heat our homes or burning it
  at a plant, converting to electricity, and then heating with
  electricity?

<!--

## Quiz Review

## Learning Objectives
- Physics of heating and cooling
- Learn how we heat and cool our homes and buildings

## Heat transfer
- Conduction
- Convection
- Radiation

## Home Heat Transfer
- Like a cup of coffee, your warm house loses heat to the environment
- Our furnaces and bodies add heat

## Home cooling
- We cool our home but heat leaks in from outside

## Conduction
- Insulation

## Convection
- Weatherstripping
- Passive ventilation

## Radiation
- White roofs
- Advanced window coatings
- Passive solar heating


## Heating, Cooling, Ventilation
These devices consume energy to heat and cool our buildings

- Combustion
- Heat pumps
- Fans

## Different climates have different demands
- Cold winters
- Humid summers

## Heating energy
- energy used = leakiness of house * temperature difference / efficiency
  of heaters

## Sources of heat
- Combustion
- Sun
- Human metabolism
- Environment

## Heat capacity
$$ Q = m C \Delta T $$

Also called sensible heat

The energy to heat a material is the product of the mass, the heat
capacity, and the change in temperature

## Calorie and BTU
This is how we define the calorie and the BTU

A calorie (4.2 J) of energy raises one gram of water by one degree celsius

A BTU (1055 J) raises one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit

## Carbon Emissions Trajectories
![Pacala and Socolow, Figure 1A](../figures/wedges1A.pdf)

## Simplified Trajectories
![Pacala and Socolow, Figure 1B](../figures/wedges1B.pdf)


## Carbon levels

| Time period   | Carbon concentration (ppm) |
|---------------|----------------------------|
| Preindustrial | 280                        |
| 2004          | 375                        |
| 2014          | 400                        |

We hope to remain under 500 ppm to avoid serious disruption.

## Carbon rates
- 7 billion tons of carbon per year
- (7 GtC/year)

## What is Business as Usual (BAU)?
- Prediction by using historical rates
- 1.5% annual emissions growth

## Wedges
A wedge is a technology that reduces emissions by 1 GtC/year within 50
years.

What are the units of area of a wedge?

## How do we calculate if a wedge is feasible?
- We can create a sample wedge from the conversion of all coal plants to
  natural gas
- How do we calculate the reduction in emissions from this change?

# Climate Change Consequences

## Climate change effects
- Mean temperature change of a few degrees
- Sea Level rise



## Climate Dice
- Small changes in mean temperature (1-2 C) don't describe increased
  extremes
- Distributions suggest much more warm weather

## Distributions
- When we shift the average temperature we also shift the extremes
- Cold extremes become less likely
- Hot extremes become more likely

## Climate dice
- James Hansen
- We can think of a weather pattern as a given die
- Climate change loads the die and changes the likelihood of
  different results for each roll of the die

## Warm anomalies
- A shift in the average temperature increases the likelihood of very
  hot weather

## Summer temperature anomalies
![](../figures/hansen-shifting-anomalies.png)


# How will we respond?

## Insurance
- Even though risk is uncertain, we protect ourselves.
- Auto insurance
- Fire insurance

## What will the future impacts be?
- Predictions based on computer climate models
- Confidence in models is increasing

## What can we do?
- Mitigation
- Adaptation
- (Geoengineering)

## Mitigation
- Actions that seek to reduce carbon emissions and avoid climate change

## Adaptation
- Actions that seek to minimize the affects of climate change


## Benefits and costs
- To pursue a plan, the benefits should outweigh the costs

<!--
- water is cheap
- consevration doesn't save much money
- what about avoided infrastructure costs?
-->

## Energy and water
- Too many intersections to cover today
- Spills: Oil spills, coal ash spills, chemical spills
- Cooling: Water is needed to cool our power plants
- Pumping: Energy is needed to move our water

# Energy and Water: Spills

## Elk River Spill
![](../figures/elk-river-spill-map.jpg)

## Elk River Spill
- Coal processing chemical leaks into river and contaminates water
  supply
- 300,000 Charleston area residents without water January 2014

## Kingston Ash Spill
![](../figures/kingston-spill.jpg)

## Kingston Fossil Plant
- 1 billion gallons of coal ash slurry released in December 2008
- 300 acres of land covered by ash
- These coal ash ponds exist around many coal plants

## Opportunity
- Can you create monitoring systems and laws that better protect our
  water and land from spills?
- Can we use coal ash for a useful purpose like concrete?
- Can we reduce our use of coal?

# Energy and Water: Cooling

## Energy and Water - Cooling
- Power plants rely on water for cooling
- 41% of the freshwater we withdraw is used for power plants
- Some plants take cold water from rivers and return warmer water to the
  river, disrupting wildlife
- When this is too warm, we must shut down plants

## Hot weather shuts down power plants
![](../figures/water-energy-ucs.png)

# Energy and Water: Pumping

## Energy and Water - Pumping
- 20% of California electricity use for water-related use
- 32% of natural gas used for water-related use

<!-- - we cut hot water with cold water -->
<!-- - we move water up a mountain -->

### Thursday, 06 Nov 2014

## Announcements
- Added link to lecture slides
- First draft feedback due tonight
- Signup sheet

## Learning Objectives
- Understand pollution effects on human health
- Climate effects on human health

## Review
- The majority of world energy is created by burning carbon
- Burning carbon creates carbon dioxide, particulates, and other
  pollutants

## Particulate effects
- Particulate or soot
- Small size allows penetration deep in lungs
- Causes asthma, bronchitis
- PM10 particles between 2.5 and 10 microns in diameter
- PM2.5 particles less than 2.5 microns

## Particulate
![EPA](../figures/pm25-EPA.jpg)


## Biomass cooking
- 2 in 5 persons rely on biomass for cooking
- Biomass cooking exposes women and children to smoke

## Biomass burning in developing world
![](../figures/three_stone-1.jpg)

## Possible solutions
- Clean cookstoves are engineered to burn more cleanly
- Changing to natural gas or biogas would avoid particulate

## Flame-based lighting
![Kerosene Lamp Pelengana, Mali](../figures/pelengana-lantern.jpg)

## Premature deaths from smoke and disease
![IEA WEO 2011](../figures/smoke-deaths.pdf)


## Coal particulates
- Burning coal creates particulate
- Mining coal also exposes humans to dangerous particulates

## Black lung
- Pneumoconiosis
- Prolonged exposure to coal dust causes scarring of lung tissue
- After a period of decreased incidence of black lung, we are back to
  high levels of diagnosis
- Black lung can be prevented through dust control technologies

## Black lung evidence suppression
- Investigations have revealed a pattern of withholding evidence in
  black lung cases

## Heat wave deaths
- CDC reports that heat waves are the leading cause of weather-related
  deaths
- Currently about 660 people die each year from heat waves
- A warming climate will mean more heat waves and higher death rates
- Estimates range from 2x to 10x increases

## NAACP coal blooded
- Report surveyed almost 400 coal plants and graded them based on
  human health impacts and social justice

## Discussion

## Existing Knowledge

- Where have you learned how to use a calculator?
- Have you learned how to use a spreadsheet?


## Required Software

- Does the class agree to spend $5 to buy Calca?
- Would everyone be able to have access to this tool?
<!-- free option is tmpnb but you can't save -->


## Basic computations

Most mathematical software uses the following symbols for basic
arithmetic.

- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Exponentiation (^ or **)

To perform basic calculations with numbers, we can type numbers into the
computer and use the symbols above to perform the calculation.


## Variables

To make the details of a computation more clear, we can use readable
names for our numbers and then use the names in the calculation.  Most
mathematical software use this simple syntax.

    power = 100
    time = 30
    energy = power * time

This makes the intention of the calculation more clear to the reader.

## Functions

A custom function can be created and used.  The syntax for this often
varies but the idea is usually the same.

    m = 1
    b = 10
    f(x) = m * x + b
    f(5) => 15


## Scientific Notation

$$6 \cdot 10^3$$ is entered as ``6E3``.

## Units

Computation of physical quantities often relies on the human to define
and use a consistent set of units of measurement.  There are tools that
allow us to add physical quantities to our calculations, but they are
not as rich as I could like them to be.  One good practice is to
explicitly include the unit name in the variable name.

    power_watt = 100
    time_sec = 30
    energy_joule = power_watt * time_sec

<!-- excel has custom formats for units? -->

## Units

Some programs can treat quantities with units.  Calca allows you to do
this.

    distance = 100 meter
    time = 12 second
    distance / time => 8.3333 meter/second

## Linear Growth

- Linear functions have the same absolute increase for equal time


## Exponential Growth and Decay

- Exponential functions have same relative increase for equal time
- What number do we multiply by itself N times to get another number?


## Activity

If a population on 1 million people is growing at 5% each year, how
large will the population be in

- 1 year?
- 2 years?
- 10 years?

![](../figures/ipcc_energy_primer.png)

## What is energy?
- Energy is defined as the capacity to do work
- Energy can be thought of as an accounting device
- Energy is never destroyed or lost, only converted
- word coined by Aristotle meaning work within
- Energy = power * time
- Distance is a useful analogy


## What is power?
- Power is how quickly we are able to consume or convert energy
- Measure in energy per unit time
- The rate at which energy is delivered.
- Speed is a useful analogy

## Efficiency
- Whenever we convert energy, we are not able to convert all of it
- A measure of how well a resource is converted
- Defined as useful energy out divided by total energy in

<!--
MathJax has a bug and this won't render
$$\eta = \frac{E_{out}}{E_{in}}$$
-->


$$\eta = \frac{E_o}{E_i}$$


<!-- need reinforcement exercises here -->

## Example Efficiencies
- Electrical generators (70--99%)
- Electric motors (50--90%)
- Gas furnace (70--95%)
- Wind turbine (35--50%)
- Fossil fuel power plant (30--40%)
- Nuclear power plant (30--35%)
- Automobile engine (20--30%)
- Solar cell (5--28%)
- Fuel cell (40--60%)

## Multiplication of efficiencies
- When we want to know the efficiency of a process with many steps, we
  multiply the efficiencies at each step to get the total.

$$\eta_{total} = \eta_1 \cdot \eta_2 \cdot \eta_3 \cdots$$

## Quiz Today


## Energy terms

- End use: what the energy is used for at the instant of consumption
- Primary energy: what is the original consumption in terms of
    energy

## Gravitational Potential Energy

$$ PE = mgh $$

- PE: potential energy in Joules
- m: mass in kilograms
- g: gravitational acceleration (9.8 meters per second squared)
- h: height above "ground" in meters

Note that a Joule has units of a kilogram meter^2 per second^2.

## Example

How much energy does it take to put your car on the roof?

    mass = 1100 kg
    gravity = 9.8 meter/second^2
    height = 5 meter
    PE = mass * gravity * height => 53,900 kg*meter^2/second^2
    PE in joule => 53,900 joule


## Kinetic Energy

$$ KE = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 $$

- KE: kinetic energy in joules
- m: mass in kilograms
- v: velocity of object

## Kinetic Energy Example

How much kinetic energy does your body contain when you are traveling at 60
miles per hour?

    mass = 70 kg
    velocity = 60 mile/hour in meter/second
      => 26.8224 meter/second

    KE = mass * velocity^2 / 2
      => 25,180.44 kg*meter^2/second^2
    KE in joule => 25,180.44 joule

<!-- what happens if you don't square the velocity? -->
<!-- units help you catch errors -->


## Activity

- What is the average primary energy use per year per person for the world?
- Make a note of your sources

## A solution

    source: IEA Key World
    2012 global primary energy is 13,371 Mtoe
    (million of tons of oil equivalent)

    global_primary_energy = 13371 MTOE * 41e15 joule/MTOE
      => 5.4821e20 joule

    global_population = 7e9 person

    global_primary_energy / global_population
      => 78,315,857,142.8571 joule/person

    global_primary_energy / global_population * 1 GJ/1e9 joule
      => 78.3159 GJ/person



## Strategies

- create mathematical model
- find and cite sources of data
- create the calculation

  elements
- Fossil fuels are not pure carbon and hydrogen, they contain impurities
  like sulfur and mercury
- When all these chemicals participate in combustion, they produce
  sulfur oxides (SO~X~), nitrous oxides (NO~X~), and other chemicals
- These chemicals are the cause of acid rain and other environmental
  effects

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the limits of energy conversion efficiency according to the
    second law of thermodynamics

## Concepts

- Temperature
- Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin Scale
- Heat Capacity
- First Law of Thermodynamics
- Second Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy Efficiency


## Temperature
- Measure of the internal energy in a system or material
- This energy is the motion, vibration, or rotation of atoms and
  molecules

## Temperature Scales
![](../figures/temperature_scales.jpg)


## Heat
- Heat is the flow of this energy from one area to another
- Conduction
- Convection
- Radiation


## Mathematical models

- Simplifications of reality that still have excellent predictive power

## Heat Engine

- Heat engines convert thermal energy to mechanical kinetic energy
- This conversion can never be 100 percent efficient

## Heat Engine

- Coal power plant turbines
- Internal combustion engines

## Heat Engines
- The heat engine is a mathematical model
- Takes the heat (flow) between two thermal reservoirs and converts some of
  that heat to work
- Heat can come from combustion or natural sources of heat

## Heat Engines
- A heat engine is more efficient when it uses a wider temperature range
    between the hot and cold sides

## Thermodynamic limit to heat engine
- Carnot derived the upper limit of efficiency for a heat engine
$$\eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}$$
- This law dictates the maximum possible efficiency for power plants
- Some of the heat must be released into the environment

<!--
what happens when T_C goes to zero?
what happens when T_C and T_H are close to each other?
-->

## Heat Engine

## Quality
![](../figures/heat_engine.jpg)

## Carnot Heat Engine
![](../figures/carnot_cycle.png)
- The most efficient heat engine possible uses a Carnot cycle
- Heat is used to expand a gas and do work and heat is removed during
  the compression of the gas.

## Power plant
![](../figures/heat_engine_plant.jpg)

## Power plant
![](../figures/coal_plant_cooling_towers.jpg)


## Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
- If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system,
  they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
- Real world example: Coffee gets cold, ice cream melts

## First Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy is conserved
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- "You can't get something for nothing"

## First Law Efficiency
- Most commonly used measure of efficiency
- Useful energy out divided by total energy in

## Second Law of Thermodynamics
- The amount of entropy (disorder) in a closed system always increases
- Heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold
- "You can't break even"

<!-- ## Second Law Efficiency -->
<!-- &#45; First law efficiency divided by best possible efficiency dictated by -->
<!--   the second law -->
<!-- &#45; It isn't always obvious what the best possible second law efficiency is -->

<!-- ## Third law of Thermodynamics -->
<!-- &#45; The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is exactly equal to -->
<!--   zero. -->
<!-- &#45; When we make calculations using the second law, we use the kelvin -->
<!--   temperature scale which starts at absolute zero. -->

<!-- ## Entropy -->
<!-- &#45; Measures the disorder in a system -->
<!-- &#45; Is related to the number of microstates -->
<!-- &#45; Equivalent to say energy must decrease in quality -->






<!-- ## Thermal Energy -->
<!--  -->
<!-- $$ TE = mc\Delta T $$ -->
<!--  -->
<!-- &#45; m: mass -->
<!-- &#45; $\Delta T$: temperature difference (Celsius or Kelvin) -->
<!-- &#45; c: heat capacity -->

## Review

- Energy efficiency


## GDP Definitions
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
    - The sum of all economic value added by residents and companies
    - Value is the value of outputs minus the value of inputs
- Per capita GDP (GDP per person)
- Per capita energy use (Joules per person)
- Energy intensity (Joules per GDP)


## Market

- A system that allows for multiple parties to participate in exchange
- We have several energy markets


## Commodity

- An item that can be substituted without regard for where or how it was created
- Energy examples: Coal, oil, and gasoline


## Market Response Model

Predicts that scarcity raises prices resulting in decreased demand or
increased supply

- Improved techniques can lower prices and increase supply
- Natural Gas Hydraulic Fracturing is an example


## Supply and Demand
![](../figures/supply-and-demand-1.pdf)


## Supply and Demand
![](../figures/supply-and-demand-2.pdf)

## Externality

A cost or benefit borne by everyone from one person's decision

<!-- examples -->
<!-- global warming -->
<!-- fish extinction -->
<!-- deforestation -->

## Coase Theorem

Externalities can be most efficiently controlled by agreements between
parties

Assumes:
- No transaction costs

<!-- where does Coase start to fail? -->

## Limits of Markets
For all their power and vitality, markets are only tools. They make a
good servant but a bad master and a worse religion.  - Amory Lovins, Natural
Capitalism

How does the real world deviate from this ideal?

## Transaction cost

The cost associated with making an exchange or agreement.

<!-- What if you have to drive to get water? -->

## Individualism/Collectivism

- Individualism emphasizes the worth of the individual over the group
- Collectivism emphasizes the needs of the group over the individual

## Prisoner's Dilemma

|              | Walter Silent    | Walter Rats      |
| -            | -                | -                |

|              | Walter 10 years  | 10 years         |

## Prisoner's Dilemma

We can use the Prisoner's Dilemma to think about emissions and other
externalities.

|             | VW reduces emissions | VW cheats           |
| -           | -                    | -                   |
| BMW reduces | Emissions reduced,   | BMW at competitive  |
| emissions   | no disadvantage      | disadvantage        |
| BMW cheats  | VW at a competitive  | Emissions increased |
|             | disadvantage         | for everyone        |

## Prisoner's Dilemma

- Now imagine the decisions of all companies in the world or all
    citizens
- Each of us can decide to do the best collective action or the best
    individual action
- Unfortunately, the best individual option can be a very bad collective
    outcome

## Free riders

- Individuals who gain a benefit from a system without contributing
- These are the folks that choose individual benefit over group cost

## Common property

- A resource accessible to all members of a society and not owned privately
- Can a market be used for something that no one pays for?
- Are commons destined to overuse?

<!-- free internet, anyone? -->

## Commons

- Difficult to enclose
- Available to all
- Prone to defection or free-riders

## Commons

Make a list of things that resemble a commons

<!-- Atmosphere -->
<!-- Groundwater -->
<!-- Fish populations -->
<!-- Rivers -->
<!-- Oil fields -->
<!-- Roadways -->
<!-- Kitchen sink -->
<!-- Bathroom -->
<!-- Office refrigerator -->

## Tragedy of the Commons

- This is an economic theory
- Garrett Hardin article 1968
- Regulation or privatization as solutions

## Question

Do you think regulation or privatization is more effective and why?

## Commons Management

- Counter-examples to Hardin's theory emerged
- Usually possessed institutions that govern human behavior
- These are called common property
- Irrigation systems
- Wildlife hunting

<!-- uses the idea of property -->

<!-- ostrom maintains common property requires -->
<!-- boundaries -->
<!-- proportionality -->
<!-- collective choice -->
<!-- monitoring -->
<!-- sanctions -->
<!-- conflict resolution -->
<!-- autonomy -->

## Regulations

- Clean Water Act
- Clean Air Act
- How did these add institutions to a commons?

## Markets and Commons Activity

- in groups find examples online of climate policies and identify the
    concepts from the reading that are used in the policy

**06 Oct 2015**

## Plan
- Intro
- Discussion of Project Topics
- Hydropower and Wind


## Deadlines

## Learning Objectives
- Recognize basic physics of hydropower and wind
- Understand environmental issues associated with hydropower and wind


## Energy basics
- We use the simplest model for the water as a mass at a height or
  elevation
- A mass $m$ lifted to a high $h$ has a stored gravitational potential
  energy of
$$ PE = mgh $$
- PE is in joules if mass is in kilograms, g = 9.8 m/s^2^ and the height
  is in meters

## Power
- How do we convert this to a power?
$$ energy = mgh $$
$$ \frac{energy}{time} = \frac{mgh}{time}$$
$$ power = \frac{m}{time} gh$$
$$ power = flow \cdot gh$$
- To get flow in mass per time we convert from volume per time

## Hydropower is significant world wide
- http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/3.7
- 2010 Hydropower 15.9% of world wide electricity
- Coal 40.5%, Nuclear 12.8%
- Largest power station in the world is hydroelectric


## Three Gorges
- Largest power plant in the world
- Displaced millions of people
- 22 GW power continuous
- NYC requires 10 GW of power


## Three Gorges
[Three Gorges

## Grand Coulee
- Largest hydroelectric installation in US
- 6.8 GW capacity
- 21 Billion kWh annual energy delivered


## Hydropower similarities to fossil generation
- Uses spinning generators just like combustion plant
- Doesn't use heat, unlike combustion plant




## Ancient Power Technology
- Waterwheels have been used for centuries
- Modern hydropower technology has added large scale dams

## Types
- Run of river
- Dams

## Building a dam
- What is the effect of a dam?
- How does the dam affect the overall flow of water?

## Climate change
- Initial increase in methane emissions

## Advantages
- Once built, very cheap power
- Reliable technology
- Can be used as storage

## Disadvantages
- Environmental impacts
- Seasonal variation
- Water flow

## Tidal Energy
- Tides caused by the moon's gravity
- Causes a daily flow of water

## Tidal power
![](../figures/tidal1.png)

## Wave Energy
- Waves are driven by the wind (which is driven by the sun)
- Uses the rise and fall of wave crests to create energy

## Activity Objective
- You will gain practice with energy conversions and estimations

## Gasoline and car height

We want to compare the chemical energy in a gallon of gasoline to the
potential energy of lifting a car?

<!-- A gallon of gasoline contains approximately 120 MJ of chemical energy. -->

## Units
- What are the units of the energy = mgh formula if we use kilograms, g=10
m/sec, and h in meters?


## Gravitational energy
If that energy were totally converted into the gravitational potential
energy of the car, how high could you lift the car?  A Honda Civic has a
weight of about 1100 kg.


## Solution
$$ PE = mgh = 120 MJ = 1100kg \cdot 9.8 m/sec^2 \cdot h $$
$$ h = 120 MJ / 1100 kg / 9.8 = 11.0 km $$

$$ Power = \frac{1}{2} \rho A v^3 $$

- $\rho$ density of air (kg per cubic meter)
- $A$ swept area of wind turbine (square meters)
- $v$ velocity of the air (meters per second)
- Power is in watts

## Air density
- How much does the air weigh?
- About 1.2 kg per cubic meter
- Varies with altitude
- Varies with temperature

## Wind speed variation with height
- Boundary layer friction
- This is turbulence caused by the ground, trees, or buildings

## Air density
Hotter air is less dense

| Temperature (degrees Celsius) | Density (kg per cubic meter) |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| 0                             | 1.29                         |
| 15                            | 1.23                         |

- Energy equals power times time


# Lecture 25, Conserved Cost of Energy

## Energy in the news
- Syrian conflict and climate change
- ISIS and airstrikes to attack petroleum income
- Reports of petroleum theft in the US

## Central question
- How much does something cost per unit of use?
- What does your car cost per mile?
- What does your phone cost per minute of use?

## Central question
- Which is cheaper, buying a more efficient product or paying the extra
    energy?
- How does this answer change if we add a carbon tax?


## Cost of conserved energy
- How much does it cost to save energy?
- You can purchase energy
- You can purchase a device that "buys" you that energy

## Conserved Cost of Energy
- Has dimensions of cost per unit of energy
$$ CCE = \frac{\textrm{Investment}}{\textrm{Energy Savings}}
$$

## Conserved Cost of Energy
- For long term investments, we do this for a year at a time
$$ CCE = \frac{\textrm{Annual Investment}}{\textrm{Annual Energy Savings}}
$$



## Cost of avoided carbon
- Allows you to calculate the value of an investment as the cost per
  amount of carbon not emitted
- Allows comparison with the current market price of carbon

$$ CCE = \frac{\textrm{Investment}}{\textrm{Carbon Savings}}
$$

## Energy Savings
- Avoided electricity
![](../figures/avoided-electricity.png)


## Lifetime Energy
- Most energy devices (lights, cars) have both recurring energy costs
    and initial energy costs
- Recurring energy: electricity to emit light or gasoline to drive
- Initial energy: energy to manufacture the bulb or the car

## Levelized energy use
- We can estimate the energy per unit of light or mile driven by
- Adding energy over the life of the device
- Dividing the energy by the amount of use over the device
- Dimensions of energy per unit of use (hours light, miles driven)

| 2014          | 400                        |

We hope to remain under 500 ppm to avoid serious disruption.

## Carbon rates
- 7 billion tons of carbon per year
- (7 GtC/year)

## What is Business as Usual (BAU)?
- Prediction by using historical rates
- 1.5% annual emissions growth

## Wedges
A wedge is a technology that reduces emissions by 1 GtC/year within 50
years.

What are the units of area of a wedge?

## How do we calculate if a wedge is feasible?
- We can create a sample wedge from the conversion of all coal plants to
  natural gas
- How do we calculate the reduction in emissions from this change?


## Pacala and Socolow
- Authors demonstrate solving climate problem with existing technologies
- Hoping to settle debate on whether current technologies are sufficient
- This is clearly stated in the introduction


## Pacala and Socolow
- What carbon level do the authors want us to stay under?
- Describe a wedge in your own words
- Which of the wedges suggested is most appealing to you and why?
- This paper is ten years old now, are there any new wedges we could
  add?

<!-- to understand this model, we look at stocks and flows -->

## Levels vs rates of emissions
- Bathtub model
- Stocks and flows
- Flow is the bathtub faucet (and drain)
- Stocks is the level of the bathtub water


## Remaining carbon budget
- To stay below a given climate target, we can only emit a given amount
  of CO~2~
- How do we allocate the remaining carbon emissions among countries?
- What constraints to these emissions place on economic growth?

## Rio Earth Summit, 1992
- Negotiated the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
  (UNFCCC)

## Kyoto Protocol, 1997
- Adopted at the 3rd Conference of the Parties (COP 3)
- China and India not required to cut
- US did not ratify the treaty
- Burden of emissions reductions placed on developed countries

## Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, 2009
- 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15)
- Viewed as a disappointment by many

## Paris, 2015
- 21st Conference of the Parties (COP 21)
- Goal of limiting average temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius
  above preindustrial levels

## Montreal Protocol, 1987
- International agreement to reduce Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other
  ozone damaging chemicals
- Provides an example of a world wide emissions reduction treaty




## California
- Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (AB 32)
    - Reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020
    - 1990 was 427 million metric tonnes of CO2 equivalent

## California 2050 goal
- 80% reduction below 1990 levels

## How do we achieve this goals?
- What can we do on a county or state level?

## Learning objectives
- Exposure to energy access issues around the world

## Big problems
- Energy Access is not universal
- 20% of the world population lives without electricity
- 40% of without modern cooking fuels

## Big opportunities
- These people spend billions of dollars on substitutes for electricity
- Better technologies could be sold profitably while lowering costs to consumers
- Electrification means connection to the internet

## Connections to disasters
![](../figures/kaplan-scrabble-sandy.jpg)

## Fuel based lighting disadvantages
- Fuel-based lighting is expensive
- Danger of fire, poisoning, or smoke inhalation
- Poor quality light

## Cell phone charging
- Consumers travel miles to charge cell phones
- Cell phone charging costs much more than the value of the electricity
- Cell phones kept off to save battery for necessary calls

## Cooking

## Biomass disadvantages
- Hours of time and effort spend gathering wood and biomass
- Women sometimes face risk of violence while gathering wood

## Traditional cooking creates smoke
