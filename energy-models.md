# Energy Models

To support decisions about our energy systems, we must make quantitative estimates in systems that are too complex to gather complete information.



# Gasoline Usage in the United States

Imagine that we did not have the US Energy Information Administration compiling statistics of gasoline usage.
If we needed to make an estimate of gasoline usage to support a decision about the speed limit of fuel consumption how would we make it?
