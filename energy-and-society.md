This section explores the intersections between human behavior, society, and our energy system.
The first chapter of this section is on the intersection of energy use and economics often at the level of countries.
The second is a survey of social theories that govern human cooperation and human environment interactions.
The third is a tour of our understanding of how human psychology and identity affect our belief in scientific evidence, especially around energy and climate.
