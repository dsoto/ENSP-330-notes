# Fossil fuels
- Fossil fuels are the product of millions of years of photosynthesis
  stored and processed under heat and pressure
- Most fuel is found in rocks from about 50-450 million years ago

<!-- ## Learning Objectives -->
<!-- &#45; You will be able to describe consequences of fossil fuel use -->
<!-- &#45; You will be able to list the major uses of coal, petroleum, and natural gas -->
<!-- &#45; You will be able to understand some of the connections between fossil fuel use and human activities -->

## Review
- Energy basics
- Estimation techniques

# Fossil Fuels

- where do we get them
- how do we use them
- why are they useful
- how are they harmful
- fossil fuel etymology latin fodere dig fossilis dug up

## Types of Fossil Fuels
- Coal
- Petroleum
- Natural Gas

## Impacts of a Global Fossil Fuel Network
- Fossil fuels are being extracted, processed, and used all over the world
- Who bears the burden of the consequences?
- Who benefits from their use?
- Where are these consequences located?
