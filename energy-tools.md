# Energy Models

To support decisions about our energy systems, we must make quantitative estimates in systems that are too complex to gather complete information.

# Power and Energy

Power is the rate of conversion of energy.

This means that energy is the product of a power and a time.

$$ E = P \cdot t $$

Usually, we make the estimation that the power is constant over the time period.

# Gravimetric Energy Density

Here is a table of the gravimetric (mass) energy densities for a few popular energy storage sources.

| Material| Energy Density (MJ/kg) |
|--------|-----|
| Gasoline  | 45     |
| Crude oil | 42--44  |
| Natural gas | 33--37 |
| Coal | 12--31 |
| Wood | 14--16 |
| Lithium Battery | 0.5 |


# Carbon Intensity

These are averages for the carbon intensity of electricity for some power plants.

| Fuel Source | Carbon Intensity |
|-------------|------------------|
| Coal        | 2249 lb CO2/MWh  |
| Natural Gas | 1135 lb CO2/MWh  |
| Proposed EPA Limit | ~ 1100 lb CO2/MWh |

# Scientific Notation

# Unit Analysis

# Gasoline Usage in the United States

Imagine that we did not have the US Energy Information Administration compiling statistics of gasoline usage.
If we needed to make an estimate of gasoline usage to support a decision about the speed limit of fuel consumption how would we make it?

# Standard Multiplier Prefixes

Often for energy quantities, we use the metric prefixes to express scientific notation.

# Energy Density (Volumetric)

This is the quantity of energy that fits in a given volume.

# Energy Density (Gravimetric)

This is the quantity of energy that fits in a given mass.
