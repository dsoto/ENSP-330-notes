There are several metrics by which we quantify the benefits of a proposed energy technology.


## Economics

- Economics is often the deciding factor for many energy decisions.

## Central questions

- How much does something cost per unit of use?
- What does your car cost per mile?
- What does your phone cost per minute of use?
- Which is cheaper, buying a more efficient product or paying the extra energy?
- How does this answer change if we add a carbon tax?

## Life-cycle assessment

The analysis of all costs, benefits, and impacts over the entire lifetime of a product.

## Cost of conserved energy
- How much does it cost to save energy?
- You can purchase energy
- You can purchase a device that "buys" you that energy

## Conserved Cost of Energy
- Has dimensions of cost per unit of energy

Simple definition

$$ CCE = \frac{\textrm{Investment}}{\textrm{Energy Savings}} $$

## Conserved Cost of Energy
- For long term investments, we do this for a year at a time

$$ CCE = \frac{\textrm{Annual Investment}}{\textrm{Annual Energy Savings}}
$$



## Cost of avoided carbon
- Allows you to calculate the value of an investment as the cost per amount of carbon not emitted
- Allows comparison with the current market price of carbon

$$ CCE = \frac{\textrm{Investment}}{\textrm{Carbon Savings}} $$


## Lifetime Energy
- Most energy devices (lights, cars) have both recurring energy costs
    and initial energy costs
- Recurring energy: electricity to emit light or gasoline to drive
- Initial energy: energy to manufacture the bulb or the car

## Levelized energy use
- We can estimate the energy per unit of light or mile driven by
- Adding energy over the life of the device
- Dividing the energy by the amount of use over the device
- Dimensions of energy per unit of use (hours light, miles driven)

## Energy Return on Investment (EROI)

- $$ EROI = \frac{E_o}{E_i} $$
- This is the ratio of the energy out for a product divided by the energy in to get that energy.
- It should be greater than one to be useful.

## Payback Time

- How long will it take for an investment to pay back the initial cost in energy savings?
