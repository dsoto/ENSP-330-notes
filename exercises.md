## Exercise
How much energy does the average person in the United States use each
year?

## Strategy
- Find a figure for US energy use
- Find a figure for the US population
- Checking units says to divide the two

<!--
- US energy use about 100 Quads (quadrillion BTU)
- US energy about 100 ExaJoules per year
- 1 Quad = 10^15 BTU = 10^18 Joules
- 300 * 10^6 persons
- 300 * 10^9 Joules per person
- divided by one year of seconds = 10.6 kW per person
-->

## Exercise
The world uses 474 EJ of energy per year.  How much is that per person per year?

## Strategy
- Find global energy use
- Find global population
- Divide

<!--
- Worldwide (wikipedia) 474 Exajoules
- population 7 billion
- 474E18 / 7E9 = 67 GJ per person
-->

## Exercise
What is the average power that each US person consumes?

## Strategy
- Use the definitions of power and energy with what we know about US
  energy usage per year

<!--
- 100 Exajoules / population / (3.14 * 10^7 seconds)
-->



## Exercise
We calculated that each American on average consumes 300 GJ of energy
each year.

How many barrels of oil would provide that amount of energy?

## Strategy
- How much energy is in a barrel of oil

<!--
- barrel of oil equivalent = 6.1 GJ = 6.1E9 Joules
- 300 GJ / 6.1 GJ/barrel = 49.1 barrels of oil
-->

## Exercise
How many kilograms of coal would provide that energy?

<!--
- coal is about 30 MJ/kg
- 300 GJ / 30MJ/kg
- 300e9 / 30e6 = 10e3 = 10 tons of coal
-->

## Strategy

## Exercise
What is the volume of this much coal?

<!--
- coal is slightly denser that water
- 1200 kg/m^3
- 10e3 kg coal / 1200 kg/m^3 = 8.3 cubic meters
- this is a 2m x 2m x 2m box
-->

## Multiplication of efficiencies
- When we want to know the efficiency of a process with many steps, we
  multiply the efficiencies at each step to get the total.
$$\eta_{total} = \eta_1 \cdot \eta_2 \cdot \eta_3 \cdots$$
