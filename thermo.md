## Thermodynamics and heat engines

A necessary and difficult topic to understand energy is thermodynamics.
This topic deals with conversion of heat energy to work or mechanical
energy and the fundamental limits in these conversions.

On mental model that may help is that hot gases have molecules traveling
in all directions.  To make a heat engine, the kinetic energy of these
molecules flowing in all directions must be converted to a kinetic
energy moving in only one direction.  Since some of the gas energy isn't
in the right direction, some of it isn't used and reduces the
efficiency.

## Concepts
- Temperature
- Heat
- Laws of Thermodynamics
- Energy Quality

## Temperature
- Measure of the internal energy in a system or material
- This energy is the motion, vibration, or rotation of atoms and
  molecules

## Heat
- Heat is the flow of this energy from one area to another
- Conduction
- Convection
- Radiation

## Heat Engines
- The heat engine is a mathematical model
- Takes the heat (flow) between two thermal resevoirs and converts some of
  that heat to work
- Heat can come from combustion or natural sources of heat
- Heat engines have limits to efficiency dictated by the laws of
  thermodynamics
- Maximum possible efficiency is related to the temperature of the hot
  reservoir and of the cold reservoir

- Heat is used to expand a gas and do work and heat is removed during
  the compression of the gas.

## Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics
- If two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system,
  they are also in thermal equilibrium with each other.
- Real world example: Coffee gets cold, ice cream melts

## First Law of Thermodynamics
- Energy is conserved
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed
- "You can't get something for nothing"

## First Law Efficiency
- Most commonly used measure of efficiency
- Useful energy out divided by total energy in

## Second Law of Thermodynamics
- The amount of entropy (disorder) in a closed system always increases
- Heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold
- "You can't break even"

## Second Law Efficiency
- First law efficiency divided by best possible efficiency dictated by
  the second law
- It isn't always obvious what the best possible second law efficiency is

## Third law of Thermodynamics
- The entropy of a perfect crystal at absolute zero is exactly equal to
  zero.
- When we make calculations using the second law, we use the kelvin
  temperature scale which starts at absolute zero.

## Temperature Scales

## Entropy
- Measures the disorder in a system
- Is related to the number of microstates

## Quality

## Thermodynamic limit to heat engine
- Carnot derived the upper limit of efficiency for a heat engine
$$\eta = 1 - \frac{T_C}{T_H}$$
- This law dictates the maximum possible efficiency for power plants
- Some of the heat must be released into the environment

## Multiplication of efficiencies
- When we want to know the efficiency of a process with many steps, we
  multiply the efficiencies at each step to get the total.
$$\eta_{total} = \eta_1 \cdot \eta_2 \cdot \eta_3 \cdots$$

## Exercise
How much energy does the average person in the United States use each
year?

## Strategy
- Find a figure for US energy use
- Find a figure for the US population
- Checking units says to divide the two

<!--
- US energy use about 100 Quads (quadrillion BTU)
- US energy about 100 ExaJoules per year
- 1 Quad = 10^15 BTU = 10^18 Joules
- 300 * 10^6 persons
- 300 * 10^9 Joules per person
- divided by one year of seconds = 10.6 kW per person
-->

## Exercise
The world uses 474 EJ of energy per year.  How much is that per person per year?

## Strategy
- Find global energy use
- Find global population
- Divide

## Simplified Photosynthesis and combustion

Photosynthesis

- CO~2~ + H~2~O + Sunlight (Radiation Energy) $\to$ C~X~H~Y~O~Z~ + O~2~

Combustion

- C~X~H~Y~ + O~2~ $\to$ CO~2~ + H~2~O + Heat Energy

## Real combustion

- The atmosphere is not purely oxygen, it also has nitrogen and other
  elements
- Fossil fuels are not pure carbon and hydrogen, they contain impurities
  like sulfur and mercury
- When all these chemicals participate in combustion, they produce
  sulfur oxides (SO~X~), nitrous oxides (NO~X~), and other chemicals
- These chemicals are the cause of acid rain and other environmental
  effects


## Carbon Intensity

| Fuel Source | Carbon Intensity |
|-------------|------------------|
| Coal        | 2249 lb CO2/MWh  |
| Natural Gas | 1135 lb CO2/MWh  |
| Proposed EPA Limit | ~ 1100 lb CO2/MWh |

## Fuel Density
$$ \textrm{Fuel Density} =
   \frac
   {\textrm{Chemical energy contained in material}}
   {\textrm{Mass of material}}
$$

## Fuel Density

| Material| Energy Density (MJ/kg) |
|--------|-----|
| Gasoline  | 45     |
| Crude oil | 42--44  |
| Natural gas | 33--37 |
| Coal | 12--31 |
| Wood | 14--16 |
| Lithium Battery | 0.5 |
