# Energy and Power

## Energy Units
- Joule
    - SI Unit.  One Newton-Meter.
- Kilowatt-Hour
    - Energy consumed by 1 kW load over one hour
- Calorie
    - Energy to heat one gram of water one degree Celsius
- Kilo-calorie
    - One thousand calories.  Used in food energy content.
- British Thermal Unit (BTU)
    - Energy to heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit
- Quad
    - One quadrillion ($10^{15}$) BTU

## What is energy?
- Energy is defined as the capacity to do work
- Energy can be thought of as an accounting device
- Energy is never destroyed or lost, only converted
- word coined by Aristotle meaning work within
- Energy = power * time
- Distance is a useful analogy


## What is power?
- Power is how quickly we are able to consume or convert energy
- Measure in energy per unit time
- The rate at which energy is delivered.
- Speed is a useful analogy


## Unit Conversions
- We may wish to compare energy units that are not consistent
- Often you can look up conversions in a table
- Other times you may need to recreate the conversion




## Back of the Envelope Calculations
- Construct a model of appropriate complexity
- Gather estimates of necessary quantities
- Calculate estimate
- Evaluate for feasibility


## Possible Activities
- Energy per person per year globally
- Equivalent power per person per year globally



# Unit conversions

## Conversions
- Factor-label method
- Unit-factor method

## Exercise
How much energy does the average person in the United States use each
year?

## Strategy
- Find a figure for US energy use
- Find a figure for the US population
- Checking units says to divide the two

## Exercise
The world uses 474 EJ of energy per year.  How much is that per person per year?

## Strategy
- Find global energy use
- Find global population
- Divide
- Worldwide (wikipedia) 474 Exajoules
- population 7 billion
- 474E18 / 7E9 = 67 GJ per person

## Exercise
What is the average power that each US person consumes?

## Strategy
- Use the definitions of power and energy with what we know about US
  energy usage per year
- 100 Exajoules / population / (3.14 * 10^7 seconds)



## Simplified Photosynthesis and combustion

Photosynthesis

- CO~2~ + H~2~O + Sunlight (Radiation Energy) $\to$ C~X~H~Y~O~Z~ + O~2~

Combustion

- C~X~H~Y~ + O~2~ $\to$ CO~2~ + H~2~O + Heat Energy

## Real combustion

- The atmosphere is not purely oxygen, it also has nitrogen and other
  elements
- Fossil fuels are not pure carbon and hydrogen, they contain impurities
  like sulfur and mercury
- When all these chemicals participate in combustion, they produce
  sulfur oxides (SO~X~), nitrous oxides (NO~X~), and other chemicals
- These chemicals are the cause of acid rain and other environmental
  effects


## Carbon Intensity

| Fuel Source | Carbon Intensity |
|-------------|------------------|
| Coal        | 2249 lb CO2/MWh  |
| Natural Gas | 1135 lb CO2/MWh  |
| Proposed EPA Limit | ~ 1100 lb CO2/MWh |
