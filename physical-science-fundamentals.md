## What is energy?
- Energy is defined as the capacity to do work
- Energy can be thought of as an accounting device
- Energy is never destroyed or lost, only converted
- word coined by Aristotle meaning work within
- Energy = power * time
- Distance is a useful analogy


## What is power?
- Power is how quickly we are able to consume or convert energy
- Measure in energy per unit time
- The rate at which energy is delivered.
- Speed is a useful analogy

## Efficiency
- Whenever we convert energy, we are not able to convert all of it
- A measure of how well a resource is converted
- Defined as useful energy out divided by total energy in

<!--
MathJax has a bug and this won't render
$$\eta = \frac{E_{out}}{E_{in}}$$
-->


$$\eta = \frac{E_o}{E_i}$$


<!-- need reinforcement exercises here -->

## Example Efficiencies
- Electrical generators (70--99%)
- Electric motors (50--90%)
- Gas furnace (70--95%)
- Wind turbine (35--50%)
- Fossil fuel power plant (30--40%)
- Nuclear power plant (30--35%)
- Automobile engine (20--30%)
- Solar cell (5--28%)
- Fuel cell (40--60%)

## Multiplication of efficiencies
- When we want to know the efficiency of a process with many steps, we
  multiply the efficiencies at each step to get the total.

$$\eta_{total} = \eta_1 \cdot \eta_2 \cdot \eta_3 \cdots$$



## Unit Conversions
- We may wish to compare energy units that are not consistent
- Often you can look up conversions in a table
- Other times you may need to recreate the conversion




## Back of the Envelope Calculations
- Construct a model of appropriate complexity
- Gather estimates of necessary quantities
- Calculate estimate
- Evaluate for feasibility


## Possible Activities
- Energy per person per year globally
- Equivalent power per person per year globally



# Unit conversions

## Conversions
- Factor-label method
- Unit-factor method

## Exercise
How much energy does the average person in the United States use each
year?

## Strategy
- Find a figure for US energy use
- Find a figure for the US population
- Checking units says to divide the two

## Exercise
The world uses 474 EJ of energy per year.  How much is that per person per year?

## Strategy
- Find global energy use
- Find global population
- Divide
- Worldwide (wikipedia) 474 Exajoules
- population 7 billion
- 474E18 / 7E9 = 67 GJ per person

## Exercise
What is the average power that each US person consumes?

## Strategy
- Use the definitions of power and energy with what we know about US
  energy usage per year
- 100 Exajoules / population / (3.14 * 10^7 seconds)



## Simplified Photosynthesis and combustion

Photosynthesis

- CO~2~ + H~2~O + Sunlight (Radiation Energy) $\to$ C~X~H~Y~O~Z~ + O~2~

Combustion

- C~X~H~Y~ + O~2~ $\to$ CO~2~ + H~2~O + Heat Energy

## Real combustion

- The atmosphere is not purely oxygen, it also has nitrogen and other
  elements
- Fossil fuels are not pure carbon and hydrogen, they contain impurities
  like sulfur and mercury
- When all these chemicals participate in combustion, they produce
  sulfur oxides (SO~X~), nitrous oxides (NO~X~), and other chemicals
- These chemicals are the cause of acid rain and other environmental
  effects


## Carbon Intensity

| Fuel Source | Carbon Intensity |
|-------------|------------------|
| Coal        | 2249 lb CO2/MWh  |
| Natural Gas | 1135 lb CO2/MWh  |
| Proposed EPA Limit | ~ 1100 lb CO2/MWh |

## Fuel Density
$$ \textrm{Fuel Density} =
   \frac
   {\textrm{Chemical energy contained in material}}
   {\textrm{Mass of material}}
$$

## Fuel Density

| Material| Energy Density (MJ/kg) |
|--------|-----|
| Gasoline  | 45     |
| Crude oil | 42--44  |
| Natural gas | 33--37 |
| Coal | 12--31 |
| Wood | 14--16 |
| Lithium Battery | 0.5 |

## Exercise
We calculated that each American on average consumes 300 GJ of energy
each year.

How many barrels of oil would provide that amount of energy?

## Strategy
- How much energy is in a barrel of oil

<!--
- barrel of oil equivalent = 6.1 GJ = 6.1E9 Joules
- 300 GJ / 6.1 GJ/barrel = 49.1 barrels of oil
-->

## Exercise
How many kilograms of coal would provide that energy?

<!--
- coal is about 30 MJ/kg
- 300 GJ / 30MJ/kg
- 300e9 / 30e6 = 10e3 = 10 tons of coal
-->

## Strategy

## Exercise
What is the volume of this much coal?

<!--
- coal is slightly denser that water
- 1200 kg/m^3
- 10e3 kg coal / 1200 kg/m^3 = 8.3 cubic meters
- this is a 2m x 2m x 2m box
-->

## Exercise
How much energy does the average person in the United States use each
year?

## Strategy
- Find a figure for US energy use
- Find a figure for the US population
- Checking units says to divide the two

<!--
- US energy use about 100 Quads (quadrillion BTU)
- US energy about 100 ExaJoules per year
- 1 Quad = 10^15 BTU = 10^18 Joules
- 300 * 10^6 persons
- 300 * 10^9 Joules per person
- divided by one year of seconds = 10.6 kW per person
