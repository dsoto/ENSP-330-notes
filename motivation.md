The overarching question as we study our energy system is whether or not
the energy system that supports our current way of life is threatening
our way of life.

We have known for over a century that our introduction of carbon dioxide
into the atmosphere increases the amount of heat energy that is trapped.
This will in turn cause our global climate system to change.  We cannot
predict with total certainty the implications of this change in the
climate, but a cautious society would try to lessen the rate and
size of the change.
