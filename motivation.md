# Chapter 1

Introduction

In this course, you will develop two skills.  One you will learn to pose
questions about energy as mathematical estimations.  These estimations
will help us understand if new technologies or policies can have a
positive impact on our energy system.  The second important skill is
that you will learn to use critical thinking skills in a quantitative
energy context.  When presented with an argument, you will be able to
determine if the argument has clear claims that are supported with
evidence.  These two skills are complementary.  Often, the evidence
supporting claims is quantitative and the skills you develop in
estimations will help you evaluate the quality of the evidence used to
support claims about new energy policies or technologies.

## Basic Concepts
- Force
- Work
- Energy
- Power

<!-- - run through each concept -->
<!-- - apple weighs about 100g -->
<!-- - difference between work and energy is subtle -->
<!-- - can you come up with an example from each of these this morning? -->

## Forms of Energy
- Gravitational
- Chemical
- Kinetic
- Radiation

## Energy conversion
- Conversion of energy is the key to making it useful

<!-- - example: chemical energy to mechanical energy -->
<!-- - write down an energy conversion from your life this morning -->

## Activity
- Brainstorm list of transformative energy technologies on paper with a
  partner
- Turn the list in at the end of class for credit.

# Energy in Antiquity

## Biological Energy Conversion
- Plants convert radiant energy into chemical energy
- Humans convert chemical energy into human activity

<!-- - We essentially burn food in our bodies -->
<!-- - since all fossil fuel comes from plants, it is essentially solar -->

## Food Gathering Techniques
- Foraging
- Hunting
- Agriculture
- Livestock

<!--
- how can you see each of these in terms of energy?
- can we think of energy impacts of our modern food system?
-->

## Fire
- Stored chemical energy in wood to heat
- Allowed for tool making
- Allowed for cooking

<!--
- Richard Wrangham, primatologist argues that:
- cooking saves energy in digestion
-->

## Fire Sources
- Wood, biomass, dung
- Coal
- Coke
- Oil
- Gas

<!--
- what sources do humans burn for use
-->

## Amplifying human power and energy
- Ancient machines
    - Lever
    - Spring

<!--
- lever converts small force over large distance to large force over
  small distance
- springs store energy as mechanical potential energy
-->

## Hunting Machines
- Bow and arrow
    - energy is stored in bow and release quickly
- Spear and Lever
    - Lever allows hunter to impart more kinetic energy to the spear
      than with the arm alone
- Guns
    - Chemical energy converted to kinetic energy in bullet

<!--
- this advantage lead to higher energy input in human diets
-->

## Human Thermoregulation
- Our superior ability to remove heat energy from our bodies allows us
  to outrun prey animals

# Beyond Human Power

## Livestock
- Oxen
- Horses
- Allowed humans to cultivate more land, but required more land for food

<!--
- Horsepower
-->

## Water power
- Water wheels
    - converts kinetic and potential energy in water to rotational
      motion
    - estimated 500,000 waterwheels in Europe

## Water Wheel
![Syria Water Wheel](../figures/syrian-water-wheel.jpg)


## Wind power
- Windmills
    - converts kinetic energy in the wind to rotational motion
    - Dates to Ancient Greece
    - 12th century in Europe
    - estimated 200,000 windmills at peak in Europe
    - estimated 600,000 windmill waterpumps at peak in 1930 in United States
- Sailing
    - Allowed long distance travel

<!--
- transatlantic voyages made possible by windpower
- these first energy sources were renewable
- population in 1930 was about 122 million so about 200 persons per
  windmill
-->

# Energy in the Fossil Fuel Era

## Steam Engine
- Invented by James Watt in approximately 1770
- Converts of chemical energy to heat to motion
- Created shift in manufacturing technology

## Internal Combustion Engine
- Inventions in the 1800s lead to first automobile patent by Karl Benz
  in 1886

<!--
- on paper write down positive and negative aspects of modern
  transportation
- then share with partner and then with class
- what are positive effects of transportation
    - goods, services
- what are negative effects?
    - pollution
    - deaths and injury
-->

## Electrification
- Coal is used as the fuel for electricity generation

<!--
- on paper, write down positive and negative aspects of electricity
- share with partner and then group
- positive effects of electricity?
- negative effects?
-->

# Consequences of Fossil Fuel Use

## Global Warming
- Widespread use of these fuels causes an increase in fossil carbon in
  the atmosphere
- Arhennius in 1896 calculated how changes in the levels of CO~2~ could
  alter surface temperature


<!--
- what is beyond dispute
- what is still under debate
-->

## Nuclear Energy
- Mass converted to thermal energy
- 1950s see the first nuclear power plants

<!--
- still the same concept
- heat is used to boil water and power a turbine
-->

## Solar Energy
"I'd put my money on solar energy...I hope we don't have to wait till oil
and coal run out before we tackle that." Thomas Edison

## Solar Energy
- Photoelectric effect discovered in 1916 by Millikan
- 1950s solar photovoltaic cells used on satellites
- Today, widespread use in private and commercial generation

## Solar Adoption
- 40 years to get to 50 GW of PV capacity
- 50 GW again in the last 2.5 years

## Future Energy Technologies?
- What technical and financial innovations will allow for more low
  carbon energy solutions?

<!--
- science-fiction time! name an invention, no matter how outlandish,
  that could impact or eliminate an energy use today.
    - efficient teleportation would eliminate car trips
    - hologram teleconferencing
