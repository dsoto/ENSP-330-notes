# Social Science Fundamentals

There is lots of emphasis on the physical aspects of energy use but
human decisions dictate the usage of energy.  Therefore, it is important
to understand some social science.

- supply and demand
- hazard risk uncertainty
- externalities
- subsidy
- hidden subsidy

## Questions
- What patterns in human behavior can be predicted that influence our
  energy use and consequences?

## Learning Objectives
- Recognize and identify key concepts from social science that influence
  energy use in society

## Readings
- Robbins
- NC-14 Human Capitalism?


## Learning Objectives

- Understand economic drivers of energy consumption
- What is the energy efficiency of a society?

## Reading

- E&S Chapter 3
- E&S Chapter 4
- Hardin, The Tragedy of the Commons
- Coase, The Problem of Social Cost

## Concepts

- GDP
- Supply and Demand
- Economic carbon intensity
- Economic energy intensity
- Market Response Model


## Review

- Energy efficiency


## GDP Definitions
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
    - The sum of all economic value added by residents and companies
    - Value is the value of outputs minus the value of inputs
- Per capita GDP (GDP per person)
- Per capita energy use (Joules per person)
- Energy intensity (Joules per GDP)


## Market

- A system that allows for multiple parties to participate in exchange
- We have several energy markets


## Commodity

- An item that can be substituted without regard for where or how it was created
- Energy examples: Coal, oil, and gasoline


## Market Response Model

Predicts that scarcity raises prices resulting in decreased demand or
increased supply

- Improved techniques can lower prices and increase supply
- Natural Gas Hydraulic Fracturing is an example

## Externality

A cost or benefit borne by everyone from one person's decision

<!-- examples -->
<!-- global warming -->
<!-- fish extinction -->
<!-- deforestation -->

## Coase Theorem

Externalities can be most efficiently controlled by agreements between
parties

Assumes:
- No transaction costs

<!-- where does Coase start to fail? -->

## Limits of Markets
For all their power and vitality, markets are only tools. They make a
good servant but a bad master and a worse religion.  - Amory Lovins, Natural
Capitalism

How does the real world deviate from this ideal?

## Transaction cost

The cost associated with making an exchange or agreement.

<!-- What if you have to drive to get water? -->




<!-- Revisit game theory and the prisoner's dilemma -->
<!-- Introduce the tragedy of the commons -->
<!-- Counter&#45;examples to the tragedy through institutions -->
<!-- Common property vs. commons -->
<!-- Who creates institutions and who follows them -->

## Learning Objectives

- Use concepts of common property to understand energy emissions decisions

## Key questions

- What happens to property when it isn't owned by anyone?
- How do markets and economics affect the usage of commons?

## Concepts


- Prisoner's Dilemma
- Game Theory
- Externalities
- Commons
- Regulations


## Individualism/Collectivism

- Individualism emphasizes the worth of the individual over the group
- Collectivism emphasizes the needs of the group over the individual

## Prisoner's Dilemma

|              | Walter Silent    | Walter Rats      |
| -            | -                | -                |
| Jesse Silent | Walter and Jesse | Walter free,     |
|              | do 6 months      | Jesse 10 years   |
| Jesse Rats   | Jesse free,      | Walter and Jesse |
|              | Walter 10 years  | 10 years         |

## Prisoner's Dilemma

We can use the Prisoner's Dilemma to think about emissions and other
externalities.

|             | VW reduces emissions | VW cheats           |
| -           | -                    | -                   |
| BMW reduces | Emissions reduced,   | BMW at competitive  |
| emissions   | no disadvantage      | disadvantage        |
| BMW cheats  | VW at a competitive  | Emissions increased |
|             | disadvantage         | for everyone        |

## Prisoner's Dilemma

- Now imagine the decisions of all companies in the world or all
    citizens
- Each of us can decide to do the best collective action or the best
    individual action
- Unfortunately, the best individual option can be a very bad collective
    outcome

## Free riders

- Individuals who gain a benefit from a system without contributing
- These are the folks that choose individual benefit over group cost

## Common property

- A resource accessible to all members of a society and not owned privately
- Can a market be used for something that no one pays for?
- Are commons destined to overuse?

<!-- free internet, anyone? -->

## Commons

- Difficult to enclose
- Available to all
- Prone to defection or free-riders

## Commons

Make a list of things that resemble a commons

<!-- Atmosphere -->
<!-- Groundwater -->
<!-- Fish populations -->
<!-- Rivers -->
<!-- Oil fields -->
<!-- Roadways -->
<!-- Kitchen sink -->
<!-- Bathroom -->
<!-- Office refrigerator -->

## Tragedy of the Commons

- This is an economic theory
- Garrett Hardin article 1968
- Regulation or privatization as solutions

## Question

Do you think regulation or privatization is more effective and why?

## Commons Management

- Counter-examples to Hardin's theory emerged
- Usually possessed institutions that govern human behavior
- These are called common property
- Irrigation systems
- Wildlife hunting

<!-- uses the idea of property -->

<!-- ostrom maintains common property requires -->
<!-- boundaries -->
<!-- proportionality -->
<!-- collective choice -->
<!-- monitoring -->
<!-- sanctions -->
<!-- conflict resolution -->
<!-- autonomy -->

## Regulations

- Clean Water Act
- Clean Air Act
- How did these add institutions to a commons?

## Markets and Commons Activity

- in groups find examples online of climate policies and identify the
    concepts from the reading that are used in the policy
