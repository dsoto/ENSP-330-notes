# Hydropower

# Energy Conversion

- Solar radiation evaporates water
- Wind currents from solar air heating move evaporated water to locations where it falls as rain
- Gravity carries water down hill
- Hydropower uses this gravitational potential energy and kinetic energy of the water to spin a turbine
- The turbine is connected to a generator, creating electricity

## Ancient Power Technology
- Waterwheels have been used for centuries
- Modern hydropower technology has added large scale dams

## Energy basics
- We use the simplest model for the water as a mass at a height or elevation
- A mass $m$ lifted to a high $h$ has a stored gravitational potential energy of $$ PE = mgh $$
- PE is in joules if mass is in kilograms, g = 9.8 m/s^2^ and the height is in meters

## Power
- How do we convert this to a power?
$$ energy = mgh $$
$$ \frac{energy}{time} = \frac{mgh}{time}$$
$$ power = \frac{m}{time} gh$$
$$ power = flow \cdot gh$$
- To get flow in mass per time we convert from volume per time

## Types
- Run of river
- Dams

## Hydropower is significant world wide
- http://wdi.worldbank.org/table/3.7
- 2010 Hydropower 15.9% of world wide electricity
- Coal 40.5%, Nuclear 12.8%
- Largest power station in the world is hydroelectric


## Three Gorges
- Largest power plant in the world
- Displaced millions of people
- 22 GW power continuous
- NYC - 10 GW

## Grand Coulee
- Largest hydroelectric installation in US
- 6.8 GW capacity
- 21 Billion kWh annual energy delivered


## Building a dam
- What is the effect of a dam?
- How does the dam affect the overall flow of water?

## Advantages
- Once built, very cheap power
- Reliable technology
- Can be used as storage

## Disadvantages
- Fish migration
- Environmental impacts
- Seasonal variation affects electricity supply
- Water flow
- Sedimentation
- Increased seismic activity
- Risk of dam failure
- Methane production from vegetation decomposition

## Hydropower similarities to fossil generation
- Uses spinning generators just like combustion plant
- Doesn't use heat, unlike combustion plant

<!-- ## Activity Objective -->
<!-- &#45; You will gain practice with energy conversions and estimations -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## Gasoline and car height -->
<!--  -->
<!-- We want to compare the chemical energy in a gallon of gasoline to the -->
<!-- potential energy of lifting a car? -->
<!--  -->
<!-- <!&#45;&#45; A gallon of gasoline contains approximately 120 MJ of chemical energy. &#45;&#45;> -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## Units -->
<!-- &#45; What are the units of the energy = mgh formula if we use kilograms, g=10 -->
<!-- m/sec, and h in meters? -->
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## Gravitational energy -->
<!-- If that energy were totally converted into the gravitational potential -->
<!-- energy of the car, how high could you lift the car?  A Honda Civic has a -->
<!-- weight of about 1100 kg. -->
<!--  -->
<!--  -->
<!-- ## Solution -->
<!-- $$ PE = mgh = 120 MJ = 1100kg \cdot 9.8 m/sec^2 \cdot h $$ -->
<!-- $$ h = 120 MJ / 1100 kg / 9.8 = 11.0 km $$ -->
